🧠 Module 8 — Acquisition Quality
Structural Growth Readiness & Compounding Capacity
________________________________________
What This Module Is
Module 8 — Acquisition Quality evaluates how different acquisition sources shape the long-term health of the system.
It does not measure performance.
It does not predict growth.
It does not optimize spend.
Instead, it answers a deeper, structural question:
“What kinds of humans are we pulling into the system — and what kind of future do those humans create?”
This module exists to prevent false growth, extractive scaling, and long-term system collapse caused by optimizing short-term metrics.

Why This Module Exists
Most analytics systems stop at:
•	CAC
•	ROAS
•	LTV
•	Retention
Those metrics answer:
“Did this acquisition work?”
This module answers:
“What does this acquisition do to the system if we scale it?”
Specifically:
•	Does this source compound trust, identity alignment, and loyalty?
•	Or does it silently introduce fragility, regret, and future churn?
•	Is growth self-reinforcing, or does it require increasing pressure to sustain?
This is the last line of defense before strategy mistakes become irreversible.

Core Design Philosophy
1. Structural, Not Performance-Based
This module measures capacity, not outcomes.
A source can:
•	Perform well today
•	And still be structurally corrosive
Conversely:
•	A source can look weak early
•	And be structurally compounding long-term
________________________________________
2. Acquisition Sources Are Not Channels
An acquisition source is a psychological intake mechanism, not just:
•	A platform
•	A campaign
•	A creative
Sources are evaluated based on:
•	Who they recruit
•	How those humans relate to the brand
•	How they behave over time
•	What kinds of relationships they form or destroy
________________________________________
3. This Module Is Diagnostic, Not Prescriptive
This module does not say:
•	“Scale this”
•	“Pause that”
•	“Spend more here”
It says:
•	“This source compounds”
•	“This source extracts”
•	“This source destabilizes”
•	“This source corrodes trust”
Strategy happens elsewhere.
This module protects the system from lying to itself.

Models in This Module
1. acquisition_sources
Purpose:
Canonical definition of acquisition sources used throughout the system.
Grain:
One row per acquisition source.
Why it matters:
This anchors all downstream diagnostics to a stable ontology.
________________________________________
2. acquisition_fingerprints
Purpose:
Encode the characteristic psychological and behavioral signature of each acquisition source.
What it captures:
•	Who the source tends to recruit
•	How those humans arrive psychologically
•	What early behaviors repeat
This is not attribution.
It is pattern recognition.
________________________________________
3. brand_fit_indices
Purpose:
Measure how structurally aligned an acquisition source is with the brand’s identity.
Key idea:
A source can “work” while pulling the brand away from itself.
________________________________________
4. relationship_load_scores
Purpose:
Measure the maintenance burden introduced by a source.
High relationship load means:
•	More support
•	More friction
•	More repair
•	More emotional cost
This is how “cheap growth” becomes expensive later.
________________________________________
5. loyalty_yield_ratios
Purpose:
Compare what the system gives vs what it gets back over time.
This is not revenue.
This is relational efficiency.
________________________________________
6. cultural_drift_vectors
Purpose:
Detect whether a source gradually shifts the culture of the customer base.
Culture drift is slow, subtle, and dangerous.
________________________________________
7. toxicity_risk_vectors
Purpose:
Surface early warning signs of:
•	Regret accumulation
•	Trust erosion
•	Exploitative dynamics
This model exists to catch problems before churn metrics spike.
________________________________________
8. growth_type_distributions
Purpose:
Classify the type of growth a source produces:
•	Compounding
•	Neutral
•	Extractive
•	Corrosive
•	Destabilizing
Growth is not binary.
It has shape.
________________________________________
9. compounding_potential_scores
Purpose:
Synthesize all upstream diagnostics into a structural capacity score.
This score answers:
“If we scaled this source, would the system become stronger or weaker?”
Important:
This is not a forecast.
It is a structural readiness signal.

What This Module Explicitly Does NOT Do
•	❌ Predict revenue
•	❌ Rank channels by ROI
•	❌ Recommend spend allocation
•	❌ Optimize acquisition
•	❌ Replace experimentation
Any attempt to use this module for those purposes is a misuse.

How This Module Feeds the System
Module 8 is the gatekeeper before the Archetypes layer.
It ensures that:
•	Archetypes are built on healthy intake
•	Identity patterns are not polluted by extractive growth
•	Strategy is constrained by long-term viability
Without this module:
•	Archetypes become reactive
•	Strategy chases noise
•	Growth looks good until it breaks
________________________________________
Early-Stage Reality (Important)
When data is sparse:
•	Many fields may be NULL
•	Scores may be conservative
•	Signals may appear weak
This is correct behavior.
Compounding cannot be proven quickly.
It must be earned over time.
A system that confidently declares compounding too early is lying.
________________________________________
Future Enrichment Expectations
As the system matures, this module will become sharper through:
•	Longer time horizons
•	Stronger cohort differentiation
•	Clearer cultural signals
•	More reliable loyalty yield patterns
No schema changes are required for this.
Only data depth.
________________________________________
Final Warning
If this module ever becomes:
•	A dashboard
•	A KPI
•	A leaderboard
•	A growth target
Then the system has already failed.
This module exists to say “no” when growth would cost too much later.

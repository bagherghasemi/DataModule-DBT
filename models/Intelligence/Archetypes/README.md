🧠 ARCHETYPES — THE BRAIN
EMAKIE Data Lab · Customer Intelligence System
________________________________________
What This Layer Is
The Archetypes layer is the cognitive control center of the EMAKIE Customer Intelligence System.
It does not segment customers.
It does not predict behavior.
It does not optimize performance.
Instead, it answers one foundational question:
“What kinds of humans structurally exist in this system — and how do they behave over time?”
Archetypes are recurring psychological patterns, not demographic groups, not marketing personas, and not static labels.
They emerge from:
•	Identity structure
•	Motivation forces
•	Need configurations
•	Value interpretation
•	Tension resolution
•	Trust dynamics
•	Relationship shape
•	Acquisition quality
This layer integrates all prior modules into a single, coherent psychological field.
________________________________________
What Archetypes Are NOT
This layer must never be interpreted as:
•	❌ Targeting segments
•	❌ Personas or avatars
•	❌ Customer clusters
•	❌ Personas based on age, gender, or location
•	❌ Predictive classifications
•	❌ “Good vs bad” customer buckets
•	❌ Static assignments
If archetypes are treated as any of the above, the system is being misused.

Core Philosophy
1. Archetypes Are Structural, Not Empirical
Archetypes represent structural patterns that can exist given the system’s ontology.
They do not require:
•	Large data volume
•	Long history
•	Fully populated metrics
They represent how humans relate to the brand, not how many of them exist.
________________________________________
2. Archetypes Are Fields, Not Buckets
Humans do not belong to archetypes.
They gravitate toward archetypes.
Therefore:
•	Archetype membership is soft, not binary
•	A cohort may resemble multiple archetypes
•	Archetypes may overlap
•	Cohorts may migrate over time
This is why the system uses:
•	Affinity scores
•	Confidence scores
•	Temporal mappings
________________________________________
3. Archetypes Are Allowed to Be Uncertain
Early in the system’s life:
•	Many signals are sparse
•	Many measures are NULL
•	Many patterns are only partially visible
This is expected and healthy.
The system explicitly models uncertainty through:
•	archetype_confidence_scores
•	Soft mappings
•	Structural fingerprints
Low confidence does not mean wrong.
It means honest.

How Archetypes Work Technically
Input Dependencies
The Archetypes layer does not ingest raw data.
It consumes only derived intelligence from:
•	Module 1 — Identity & Reality Gap
•	Module 2 — Intent vs Value
•	Module 3 — Creative → Customer Truth
•	Module 4 — Motivation Psychology
•	Module 5 — Price Meaning
•	Module 6 — Trust & Friction
•	Module 7 — Relationship Shape
•	Module 8 — Acquisition Quality
This guarantees:
•	Psychological coherence
•	No leakage of tactical noise
•	Stable interpretability

Archetypes Are Defined in Five Models
1. archetype_definitions
Defines what kinds of humans can exist in this system.
•	Stable
•	Low cardinality
•	Human-readable
•	Strategically meaningful
This is the ontology of human patterns.
________________________________________
2. archetype_fingerprints
Encodes what defines each archetype across all modules.
•	Which forces dominate
•	Which tensions exist
•	Which risks compound
•	Which signals matter most
Fingerprints are descriptive, not evaluative.
________________________________________
3. cohort_to_archetype_mapping
Expresses affinity, not assignment.
•	Cohorts may map to multiple archetypes
•	Affinity is continuous, not binary
•	Mapping is temporal
This enables migration analysis.
________________________________________
4. archetype_transition_paths
Tracks how archetypes:
•	Emerge
•	Transform
•	Fragment
•	Decay
This reveals system-level evolution, not individual churn.
________________________________________
5. archetype_confidence_scores
Measures how much the system actually knows.
Confidence depends on:
•	Signal completeness
•	Temporal depth
•	Cross-module agreement
•	Stability of upstream intelligence
This prevents false certainty and over-interpretation.

How to Read Archetypes (Correctly)
When using this layer, always ask:
•	Why does this archetype exist?
•	What tension defines it?
•	What kind of growth does it enable or resist?
•	What does scaling this archetype do to the system?
•	How confident are we in this interpretation?
Never ask:
•	“Which archetype is best?”
•	“Which archetype should we target?”
•	“Which archetype converts most?”
Those questions belong outside this layer.
________________________________________
How Archetypes Evolve Over Time
Archetypes are living constructs.
As the system matures:
•	NULLs fill in naturally
•	Curves stabilize
•	Transitions become visible
•	Confidence increases
Archetypes do not need redesign.
They only need enrichment.
If archetypes change radically without structural changes upstream, that is a red flag.
________________________________________
Guardrails (Non-Negotiable)
•	Archetypes must remain brand-specific
•	Archetypes must remain non-judgmental
•	Archetypes must allow migration
•	Archetypes must expose risk, not hide it
•	Archetypes must never be frozen as identity labels
________________________________________
Why This Layer Exists
Without Archetypes:
•	Insights stay fragmented
•	Strategy stays reactive
•	Growth decisions stay local
•	The system cannot reason globally
With Archetypes:
•	The system becomes intentional
•	Tradeoffs become visible
•	Growth can be shaped, not chased
•	Strategy gains memory
This is not a reporting layer.
This is where the system thinks.
________________________________________
Status: Archetypes v1
Current state:
•	Structural
•	Conservative
•	Honest
•	High-leverage
Future state:
•	Richer
•	More confident
•	More predictive
•	Still disciplined
No shortcuts will be taken.
